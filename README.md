Preface
=======

While the [EPUB3 specification](http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html) includes support of HTML5/CSS/JS as a distributable package file, in practice many readers have poor and/or selective [coverage](http://epubtest.org/results/).

[Section 2.9 Scripting](http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html#sec-scripting) of the EPUB3 specification advises:

> EPUB strives to treat content declaratively â€” as data that can be manipulated, not programs that must be executed

While it's possible to integrate communication to a [Learning Record Store (LRS)](https://lrs.adlnet.gov/xAPI/) via javascript in an epub file, it's important to understand the risks involved. Using an approach of graceful degradation will limit the likelyhood that a book would become unreadable. This finding led to the development of a [xapi-html5-data-attributes](http://github.com/adlnet/xapi-html5-data-attributes).

Ideally, supporting communication to an LRS at the client (reader) level is preferred, this is still undergoing investigation.

##### Additional caveats to be aware of

- Apple "requires" a .plist file for metadata read by iBooks, which is outside the specification
- CSS in books can be overridden by a reader
- It is important to maintain accessibility
